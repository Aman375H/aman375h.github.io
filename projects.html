                            The ReVert mission is to empower people to live vibrantly and elegantly but in a sustainable way.
                            I joined ReVert in June of 2020 to develop an app to accompany a smart powercube. To that end, I
                            developed an app that not only gives customers the ability to control when their plugged-in
                            devices turn on or off, but also provide key data insights into when they <i>should</i> turn
                            their devices on or off based on our analysis of their consumption patterns.

                            Othello is a game I used to play a lot as a kid. When given the opportunity in a final project to
                            choose a game to create an A.I. for, I knew I had to take a
                            crack at Othello. The computer agent uses <a href="https://medium.com/@quasimik/monte-carlo-tree-search-applied-to-letterpress-34f41c86e238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to
                            quickly find good moves to play, and I have yet to beat it. The game model and
                            A.I. were originally coded in Python and then traspiled to JavaScript for this
                            website using <a href="https://www.transcrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transcrypt</a>.

                            I created Yale Forum along with David Padron-Castillo and Philena Sun during our first
                            year at Yale. The inspiration for the app came from our own experiences feeling a bit 
                            lost and searching for answers when we first got to campus. Thus, Yale Forum was born
                            as a way for students to ask niche questions to their fellow classmates and get quick
                            answers.
