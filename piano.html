        <p>I've never been formally taught how to play the piano, but I've loved the beautiful sound of piano music for a long time. I've learned how to play many pop songs over the years including "Stereo Hearts" and "My Heart Will Go On".</p>
        <p>It seems like everyone at Yale is secretly a piano prodigy, and I feel a little intimidated at times. Still, people always smile when they hear me playing familiar songs, and I will continue to learn more, one YouTube tutorial at a time.</p>
